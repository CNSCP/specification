# CNS/CP Licensing #

The CNS/CP specification  was developed by and is the intellectual property of Padi, Inc. It is Padiâ€™s intention to promote and encourage the widespread and royalty-free use of CNS/CP by the public. To that end, PADI is committed to developing a framework to license the specification on a perpetual, royalty-free, and non-revocable basis. 
* CNS/CP plans to submit the CNS/CP specification for standardization by a recognized standards organization. 
* Upon completing the standardization of CNS/CP, Padi is committed to licensing the CNS/CP mechanism on a royalty-free basis to one or more CNS Licensee(s).
* These licensees will sub-license CNS/CP to the public.

These sub-licenses shall be royalty-free and public subject to the following conditions:
* That any Connection Profiles created must be made available for anyone to access, view, and use for free and without restriction under the CC-BY-ND license.
* That any Connection Profiles created must be placed into a federated Connection Profile Registry following procedures established by the CNS Licensee(s).*
* That the federated Connection Profile Registry will be managed by the CNS Licensee(s) and made available to the public for free and without restriction.

Until completion of the standardization process, Padi encourages comment and debate on the CNS/CP mechanism and invites individual requests for standalone licenses for research, education, and experimentation purposes. 

This document is not intended as a license, but rather a statement of intention.
