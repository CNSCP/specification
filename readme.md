# CNS/CP Readme

This repository hold work in process on the CNS/CP specification. Connectivity Naming System and Connection Profiles (CNS/CP).

CNS/CP defines information exchanges to support creating connections between independent systems to compose systems of systems. CNS/CP enables system developers and integrators to create and propagate public common metadata to enable interactions between systems ("Connection Profiles") and for private organizations to use those profiles to validate entry points to specifica systems using these profiles.

The current draft of specification can be found in cns-cp.md (https://github.com/CNSCP/specification/blob/main/cns-cp.md)

We welcome comments and suggestions
